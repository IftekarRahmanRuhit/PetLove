# PetLove - Pet Adoption Platform


## Description Of The Project

PetLove is a user-friendly web application designed to facilitate the adoption of pets. The platform allows users to view different kinds of pets, such as dogs, cats, rabbits, categorized according to their type. It has a nice, clean interface with a grid layout showing cards of pets; each of the cards shows the name, breed, gender, and price of the pet. It filters pets by category, displays the details of a particular pet, and starts the adoption process, including a countdown modal after clicking an "Adopt" button. The application fetches data from a API, ensuring real-time information and an engaging experience for potential pet adopters.
